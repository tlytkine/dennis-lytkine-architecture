            <div class="service-detail">
                <h3>Plan Review &ndash; Faster Approvals, Quicker Project Start</h3>
                <p>Plan review is the first step in obtaining a building permit. Our plan review service ensures that your building plans comply with all local and state building codes. At Private Provider SWFL, we expedite the plan review process, ensuring that your project can move forward faster.</p>
                <p>Since local building departments are not performing the review when you work with Private Provider SWFL, municipalities are legally required to discount typical permit fees and issue permits in 20 days or less. This means you can break ground sooner and avoid the delays often associated with traditional permitting.</p>

            <div class="service-detail">
                <h3>Building Inspections &ndash; Keeping Your Project on Track</h3>
                <p>We know that timely inspections are crucial for keeping your project moving forward in Southwest Florida. Our licensed inspectors conduct detailed inspections to ensure your project complies with the Florida Building Code. If any deficiencies are found, we don't just give you a fail notice&mdash;we offer solutions and alternatives to keep your project on track.</p>
                <p>As your inspection partner, we communicate directly with your local building department, keeping them informed of your project's progress. Under Florida Statute 553.791, municipalities are required to discount permit fees for projects with third-party inspections, helping reduce costs and minimize delays. With Private Provider SWFL, you get the benefit of less red tape and on-time project delivery.</p>
